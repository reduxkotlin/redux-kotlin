# Ecosystem

Redux is a tiny library, but its contracts and APIs are carefully chosen to spawn an ecosystem of
tools and extensions, and the community has created a wide variety of helpful addons, libraries, and
tools. You don't need to use any of these addons to use Redux, but they can help make it easier to
implement features and solve problems in your application.

ReduxKotlin ecosystem is currently very small.  This list will be updated as needed.  

For inspiration or examples, the JS ecosystem is quite rich and [can be explored
here](https://redux.js.org/introduction/ecosystem).

**[Presenter-middleware](https://github.com/reduxkotlin/presenter-middleware)**  
A middleware for writing concise UI binding code and no-fuss lifecycle/subscription management.
