# Motivation

Redux for mobile is relatively new architecture, basically starting in 2016. It was borrowed from
the web where it has a huge adoption. There have been _many_ libraries published for Android & iOS,
but the ecosystem has not grown like it has for the web.

ReduxKotlin.org aims to create a standard Redux for Kotlin apps that can be used for Android or
sharing code between Android, iOS, web.

Redux as a pattern for sharing code between platforms looks promising, especially in the future with
Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI. For an example of shared code in a SwiftUI app look at the
[MovieSwiftUI-Kotlin](https://github.com/reduxkotlin/MovieSwiftUI-Kotlin) example.
